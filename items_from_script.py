'''This script analyzes the .script file used by EyeLink and from it extracts
the question items as well as the sentence items.
The question items are used to create an answer key to check if subjects respond
correctly to a given question.
The sentence items are used to (manually) create a .del (delimited) file, which
in turn is read in by generate_R_table.py and turned into a .reg (region) file.
